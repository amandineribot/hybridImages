# hybridImages
Assignment 1 Computational Photography Fall 2017
https://photography-assign.appspot.com/hybrid.php

Four   matlab   files   are   used
- hybrid_image_starter.m
- hybridImages.m - align_images.m - pyramids.m

To   run   the   code,   you   need   to   open   and   run   the   hybrid_image_starter.m   file.
The   images   used   in   the   assignment   are   already   in   the   code   (clinteastwood.jpg, clinteastwood_monkey.jpg).   To   change   them   for   other   images   (more   images   are   available   in   the images   folder),   change   the   code   at   line   4   and   5   of   hybrid_image_starter.m.

The   sigma   value   for   the   filter   (cutoff_low,   cutoff_high)   has   been   set   at   8   for   this   example.   To change   it,   change   the   values   at   line   21   and   22   of   hybrid_image_starter.m.
You   will   need   to   select   two   points   on   each   image   for   the   alignment/resized   and   rotation   (take points   around   the   eyes).

You   will   need   to   select   two   points   to   crop   the   hybrid   image.

The   original   images,   the   Fourier   transform   images,   the   hybrid   images   and   the   pyramids   will   all show   up   in   separate   figures.

The   pyramids   are   done   using   the   hybrid   image   and   a   level   of   5.
